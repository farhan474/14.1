4) A query string is the ending part of the url that is the search parameters

6) An HTTP request is when a browser asks for a page on a server
7) An HTTP response is when the server returns something or gives back an error
8) An HTTP header is the meta data the server retruns. Ex. the languge of the content, the date, the status
